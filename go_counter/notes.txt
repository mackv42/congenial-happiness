Plan of attack: 
	get 10 most relevant corners from shi tomoshi algorithm
	inside of cropped frame do another shi tomashi with several more:
			// unsure if I should use min/max x,y values for line or linear regression... we'll see
		sort points by x value loop(!empty, {get slope of first 2, remove points that are too far from line,
													 return (popped non-outliers, line)}): 
		sort points by x value loop(!empty, {get slope of first 2, remove points that are too far from line,
													 return (popped non-outliers, line)}): 


	With above psuedo code we now have a list of horizontal and vertical lines

	## uncertain ##
	get mean horizontal and vertical_slope from lines
	get mean distances of lines ( i get it changes if they're not parralell ) but we can use our points
